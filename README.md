### Imports

```javascript
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

- `useSWR`: A React Hook library for remote data fetching.
- `useRouter`: Next.js hook for routing.
- `useState`, `useEffect`: React hooks for managing state and side effects.

### Functional Component

```javascript
export default function NewTask({ params }) {
```

This component expects `params` as a prop which contains the `id` of the task. If `id` is present, it indicates an update operation.

### State Management

```javascript
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
```

The component maintains the state for `title` and `description` using the `useState` hook.

### Data Fetching

The component fetches task details if an `id` is provided.

```javascript
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());
const { data, error } = useSWR(`/api/tasks/${id}`, fetcher);
```

The `useSWR` hook is used here with a custom `fetcher` function.

### Form Submission

The form submission handles both the creation of a new task and the updating of an existing task.

```javascript
const onSubmit = async (e) => {
  // ... implementation
};
```

### Render

The component renders a form which accepts the task title and description. Based on the presence of `id` in `params`, it either shows the "Update task" or "Create task" button. If `id` is present, a "Delete task" button is also displayed.

## Starting the Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
