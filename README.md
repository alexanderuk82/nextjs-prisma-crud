Functional Component
javascript
Copy code
export default function NewTask({ params }) {
This component expects params as a prop which contains the id of the task. If id is present, it indicates an update operation.

State Management
javascript
Copy code
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
The component maintains the state for title and description using the useState hook.

Data Fetching
The component fetches task details if an id is provided.

javascript
Copy code
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());
const { data, error } = useSWR(`/api/tasks/${id}`, fetcher);
The useSWR hook is used here with a custom fetcher function.

Form Submission
The form submission handles both the creation of a new task and the updating of an existing task.

javascript
Copy code
const onSubmit = async (e) => {
// ... implementation
};
Back to Top

Render
The component renders a form which accepts the task title and description. Based on the presence of id in params, it either shows the "Update task" or "Create task" button. If id is present, a "Delete task" button is also displayed.

## Starting the Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
